Part I (75%): Write a client program and a server program to implement the following simplified HTTP protocol based on TCP service.
Please make sure your program supports multiple clients. The webpage file CS3700.htm is provided. You may choose a port like 5678
and hard code it in both client and server programs. (Hints: for testing both programs on the same computer, you may want to put client
program and server program at two different directories. Do NOT hard code the file name “CS3700.htm”!)

The ending signature of the entity body in the HTTP response message for the case “200 OK”:
o When the HTTP Server program sends a HTTP response message out, it pads four continuous blank lines, i.e., “\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n”,
to the end of the .htm file as the ending signature of the entity body.
o When the HTTP Client program read the HTTP response message line by line, it counts the number of continuous lines that
are empty strings “” (NOT a null string). Once such number reaches 4, the entity body has been fully received.
o It is assumed that the .htm file does not include such ending signature (in the real practice, length of the entity body may be
included in the head line and used to determine the end of an entity body).
• HTTP Client Program:
1. Display messages on the standard output to ask the user to input the DNS name/ip of your HTTP server.
2. Buildup the TCP connection to your HTTP server with the Host Name input by User at the given port, and display the RTT of
establishing this TCP connection in millisecond (the difference between the moments right before and after creating the
socket object). Catch the exception, terminate the program, and display error messages on the standard output if any.
3. Display messages on the standard output to ask the user to input the HTTP method type, name of the htm file requested, HTTP
Version, and User-Agent, respectively (separately please!). (hint: all inputs can be strings.)
4. Use the above inputs from user to construct ONE HTTP request message and send it to the HTTP server program over the TCP
connection. Your HTTP request message only needs to include the following lines. (Hint: At the end of each line including
the last empty line, a “\r\n” is needed. The correctness of the format will be checked by the instructor.):
The request line (hint: the URL should include a ‘/’ in front of the htm file name)
The header line for the field “Host:”
The header line for the field “User-Agent:”
<empty line>
5. Receive and interpret the HTTP response message from the HTTP Server program line by line, display the RTT (File
Transmission Time may be included) of HTTP query in millisecond (the difference between the moment right before HTTP
request is sent and the moment right after HTTP response is received) as a single line (e.g., RTT = 1.089 ms), display the status
line and header lines of the HTTP response message on the standard output, and save the data in the entity body to a .htm file
to local directory if there is any. (Hint: (a) When one empty string “” (NOT a null string!) is read the FIRST TIME, it indicates
the header lines are over and the entity body is going to start next line if the case is “200 OK”.)
6. Display a message on the standard output to ask the User whether to continue. If yes, repeat steps 3 through 6. Otherwise, close
all i/o streams, TCP connection, and terminate the Client program.
• HTTP Server Program:
1. Listen to the given port and wait for a connection request from a HTTP Client.
2. Create a new thread for every incoming TCP connection request from a HTTP client.
3. Read, display to the standard output, and interpret incoming HTTP request message line by line
o If the method given in the request line is NOT “GET”, it is a “400 Bad Request” case
o If the file specified in the URL does not exit/cannot be open, it is a “404 Not Found” case
o Otherwise, it is a “200 OK” case
4. According to the case discovered above, construct ONE HTTP response message and send it to the HTTP client program over
the TCP connection. Your HTTP response message needs include the following lines using the HTTP message format. (Hints:
1. at the end of each line including those empty lines, a “\r\n” is needed; 2. the body part including the four extra empty lines
at the end is for the 200 OK case only)
The status line
The header line for the field “Date:”
The header line for the field “Server: ”, you may use any value of your choice
<empty line>
Data read from the requested HTML file line by line … (hint: for the 200 OK case only)
<empty line> (hint: for the 200 OK case only)
<empty line> (hint: for the 200 OK case only)
<empty line> (hint: for the 200 OK case only)
<empty line> (hint: for the 200 OK case only)
5. Repeat Step 3 through 4 until a null is read. (Hint: this happens when THIS client closes the TCP connection.)
6. Close all i/o streams and the TCP socket for THIS Client, and terminate the thread for THIS client. (Hint: when this happens, the parent thread is still alive doing Steps 1 and 2 forever, unless the Server process is killed/terminated.)
Part II (25%): Test your programs on the Virtual Servers in the cloud and your local computer.
Warning: to complete this part, especially when you work at home, you must first (1) connect to GlobalProtect using your NetID account; then (2) connect to the virtual servers cs3700a and cs3700b using sftp and ssh commands on a MAC computer or using software like PUTTY and PSFTP on a Windows machine. (See Lab 1 on how to.)

ITS only officially supports GlobalProtect on MAC and Windows machines. If your home computer has a different OS, it is your
responsibility to figure out how to connect to cs3700a and cs3700b for programming assignments and submit your work by the cutoff
deadline. Such issues cannot be used as an excuse to request any extension.
1. CREATE a directory “HW03” under your home directory on cs3700a.msdenver.edu and cs3700b.msudenver.edu, a subdirectory
“server” under “HW03” on cs3700a.msudenver.edu, and a subdirectory “client” under “HW03” on cs3700b.msudenver.edu.
2. UPLOAD and COMPILE the server program under “HW03/server” on cs3700a and the client program under “HW03/client” on
cs3700b.
3. TEST the server program running on cs3700a. together with a client program running on your local Windows or Mac computer
and another client program, simultaneously, running on cs3700b.msudenver.edu to test all the possible cases. For testing, the
server program always has to start running first before starting any client program. Meanwhile, if you want, you can always run
a TELNET client on cs3700b to test your server program independently first before even running your client program.
4. SAVE a file named testResultsClient.txt under “HW03/client” on cs3700b., which captures the output messages of your client
program when you test it. You can use the following command to redirect the standard output (stdout) and the standard error (stderr)
to a file on UNIX, Linux, or Mac, and view the contents of the file
java prog_name_args | tee testResultsClient.txt //copy stdout to the .txt file
cat file-name //display the file’s contents.
5. If you work in a team of two students, you must put a team.txt file including both team members’ names under your HW03/server
on cs3700a (both team members are required to complete Task II under their own home directories on cs3700a and cs3700b).
For testing and grading, I will randomly pick the submission in one of those two home directories, and then give both team members
the same grade for Task I.
